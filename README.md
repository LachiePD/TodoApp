First commit for new Todo app. 
Next need to implement MongoDB into it, to save user data.
Need to create 'delete' functionality for the todos.
Would like to add 'finished' or 'unfinshed' to the todo Block.
Should probably save finished todos somewhere. 
Sould probably create login user/password maybe?
Check whether tasks are recurring? Start recurring tasks


A bit of dressing would be nice, default components arnt all that groovy.
Maybe implement a spotify color scheme? Remeber material UI design principals with color levels.
